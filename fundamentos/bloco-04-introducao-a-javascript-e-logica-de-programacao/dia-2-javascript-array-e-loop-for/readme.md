# Exercises

For the following exercises (from 1 to 7) we will use this array:

```
let numbers = [5, 9, 3, 19, 70, 8, 100, 2, 35, 27];
```

1 - interate through the array and print to the console all the values;
2 - Sum all number of the array and print the result to the console;
3 - Calculate the arithmetic mean of all the array's values;
4 - Based on the result of the third exercise, if the value is greater
than 20, then print to the console "value greater than 20", otherwise,
print "value less than or equal to 20";
5 - Using `for`, find out what is the greatest value inside the array and
log it to the console;
6 - Find out how many odd numbers there is in the array and log it to the
console. If there is none, print to the console "no odd number found.";
7 - Using `for`, find out the smaller value inside array and print it to the console;
8 - Using `for`, create an array whose values are from number 1 to number 25 and log to the console;
9 - Using the array created in the last exercise, log to the console the result of the division of each one of its elements by `2`.
