### Summary of today's lessons

## You will be able to:

- Brake big problems into smaller ones;
- Use logic in problem solving

## Today's exercises

1. Create an algorithm that return the factorial of 10;
2. Create an algorithm that invert the letter of a word;
3. `let array = ['java', 'javascript', 'python', 'html', 'css'];`
   Write two algorithms: one that return a largest word of `array` e another that return
   the smaller.
4. Write an algorithm that return the biggest odd number between 0 and 50.

## Bonus exercises

1. Create a program that, given a variable `n`, and being `n > 1`, print to the console a square
   made out of asterisks, whose sides are equal to `n`. Example:

   ```
   n = 5

    *****
    *****
    *****
    *****
    *****

   ```

2. Create this time a program that prints to the console a triangle made of asterisks, simillarly
   to the last exercise.

   ```
   n = 5

      *
      **
      ***
      ****
      *****
   ```

3. Now invert the tringle, like that:

```
    n = 5

        *
       **
      ***
     ****
    *****

```

4. Make a pyramid of asterisks, whose base is `n`:

```
  n = 5

    *
   ***
  *****

```

5. Make a pyramid, whose base lenght is `n` asterisks, and that be empty inside. Assume that `n`
   will always be odd.

   ```
    n = 7

       *
      * *
     *   *
    *******
   ```

6. Create a program that say if a given number, assigned to a variable, is odd or even.
